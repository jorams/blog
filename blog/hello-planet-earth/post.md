After spending far too much time tweaking this site, I've decided to throw some
of it away and just put it online. I hope having it up will get me to actually
write anything.

This site is powered by [Hakyll][]. I'd prefer a Common Lisp-based system, for
various reasons, but I haven't found any that matched Hakyll and Pandoc.

Hello, and welcome. Let's see what happens.
